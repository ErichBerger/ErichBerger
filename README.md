## Welcome!

I'm Erich, a recent CS grad working on building skills while looking for new opportunities

- I'm currently experimenting with SPA-like applications with minimal client-side code, using Go and HTMX
- I'm interested in software design and writing code with strong foundations
- Fun fact: I still have 6 of my baby teeth!
